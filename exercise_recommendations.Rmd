Function 1:

```{r cars}
type_of_activities <- function(type, activity) {
  # List of activities and their types
  activity_types <- list(
    "physical_activity" = c("tummy_time", "jumping", "walking", "climbing"),
    "moderate_activity" = c("biking", "hiking", "dancing", "brisk_walking"),
    "vigorous_intensity_activity" = c("lifting", "running", "swimming", "aerobics")
  )
}
```

## Convert intp to lowercase

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
type <- tolower(type)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
